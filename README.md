# angular-three
Starter/seed/example project combining Angular, THREE.js, guilb&amp;webpack and some other useful stuff

Based on pretty sweet Yeoman gulp-angular generator (https://github.com/swiip/generator-gulp-angular). Couldn't find decent non-MEAN angular generator, I can recommend this one.

THREE.js part based on this example: https://jsfiddle.net/theo/VsWb9/
